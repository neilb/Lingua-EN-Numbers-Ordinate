1.04_02 2021-03-22 NEILB
    - Sigh. I used // in the changes I made to tests,
      which meant it failed on pre-5.10 perls. Refactored.

1.04_01 2021-03-21 NEILB
    - Extended tests to give full coverage, which prompted:
    - Refactored logic in ordsuf(), which resolves a warning.
      It says it will take cardinals, but then the doc also
      says that if you send nonsense, you'll get back "th"
      as the suffix. So maintained that behaviour.
    - Fixed repo URL to reflect my changed github username
