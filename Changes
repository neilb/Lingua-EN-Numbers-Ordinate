Revision history for Perl module Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate

1.04_01 2021-03-21 NEILB
    - Extended tests to give full coverage, which prompted:
    - Refactored logic in ordsuf(), which resolves a warning.
      It says it will take cardinals, but then the doc also
      says that if you send nonsense, you'll get back "th"
      as the suffix. So maintained that behaviour.
